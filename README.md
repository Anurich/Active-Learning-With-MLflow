# Active Learning With MLflow

### Task 
This repository shows how we can use Active Learning with MLflow. In this experimentation I utilise Active Learning to train <b> Sentiment Analysis task </b>,
and use MLFlow to do the experiment tracking, model, code versioning. I also show how to do the code reproducibility using MLFlow by creating different files like 
MLporject, conda.yaml which can be found inside src directory.
